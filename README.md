## Promoting Energy and Economic Empowerment with Python

Data Transformation and Machine learning

### Project Info
I created a tool to do solar power simulations over a 20 year time and tested it on my city, Porto, with several values of electricity average monthly bills. The goal is to give, for each average monthly bill, the best solar solution (which and how many solar panels, if a battery, and which battery, would be a good idea) to maximize the return of the investment.

The report was published by [Towards Data Science](https://github.com/).

The most important parts of the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/perkier/Perkier.Energy).

### Used Tools 
- Code written in python 
- Data-Science libraries such as Pandas, sklearn and numpy, 
- Solar PV library PVlib; 
- Web Scrapping Library - Beautiful Soup;
- Machine Learning techniques to fit a consumption function curve to functions with different regression degrees were run and the degree with less error was found.

### Results

It was proven that solar panels can be a great long-term investment and batteries can make that investment even more profitable.
We can draw a line between the number of watts hour consumed during a time period and the number of solar panels that your house should need. The number of panels installed should be able to generate that power at the same time period. That way, the solar installation will generate 200% emotional profit and 400% of real, monetary, profit.

Renewable energies can be a great way to empower new generations of people. Saving, at average, 620€ per year can be a big leap forward in people’s lives and with smart investments, the money saved on the electrical bill can become a game changer to entrepreneurs and companies.


## CFD Machine Learning Module 

Data Science tools to handle and prepare the data; Machine Learning Regression; Deep Learning Regression;

### Project Info
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is (...). Such precision and complexity requires computational time. With enough data it is possible to generalize the previous simulations to other cases. I built a module that makes easier for a team to predict the other results of CFD simulations.

A module that does:
1. Pre-Processing of the data such as reading and compiling the data, feature scaling, splitting the data, defining training sets, etc. ;
2. Chooses the best Machine Learning Module to use and choses the best hyper parameters to use;
3. Interprets the data from the hyperparameters selection;
4. Creates a Machine Learning Playground where the data is fitted in a selected model (this model can be selected or choosen automaticly via the module calculations);
5. Tests the data and gives visual comparisson with previous simulation results;

### Used Tools 
- Coded in python 
- Data-Science libraries such as pandas and numpy
- Machine learning libraries sklearn and ngboost 
- Deep Learning library Tensorflow.

## CFD Result Analysis - Mesh Independance 
Data exploration and analysis;

### Project Info

The grid independence needs to be studied in order to minimize the impact of the grid size on discretization errors and computational cost. The grid size needs to be optimized to be small enough to guarantee that the results are independent of the mesh. The usual process is to increase 20-25% the mesh cells and compare the final flow results, defining an error-margin (normally 1-2%). However, there is no way to know where the difference is.

[Mesh Independance script](https://github.com/perkier/CFD/blob/master/Result_Analysis/Mesh_Independance_Analysis.py) compares a user-defined parameter (e.g. velocity) between the denser mesh and the original mesh. Finite Volumes techniques were used to approximate the denser mesh with the original one, as the coordinates of each cell varied between the meshes.

### Used Tools 

- Coded in python;
- Data-Science libraries such as pandas and numpy;
- Finite Volumes method;
