## Promoting Energy and Economic Empowerment with Python

I created a tool to do solar power simulations over a 20 year time and tested it on my city, Porto, with several values of electricity average monthly bills. The goal is to give, for each average monthly bill, the best solar solution (which and how many solar panels, if a battery, and which battery, would be a good idea) to maximize the return of the investment.
The report was published by [Towards Data Science](https://github.com/).
This report can be useful by consumers or companies.
The most important parts of the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/perkier/Perkier.Energy). The code can be found 

### Tools Used
Code written in python with Data-Science libraries such as Pandas, sklearn and numpy, PVlib (Solar PV library) and Beautiful Soup (Web Scrapping Library).

### Results
It was proven that solar panels can be a great long-term investment and batteries can make that investment even more profitable.
We can draw a line between the number of watts hour consumed during a time period and the number of solar panels that your house should need. The number of panels installed should be able to generate that power at the same time period. That way, the solar installation will generate 200% emotional profit and 400% of real, monetary, profit.
Renewable energies can be a great way to empower new generations of people. Saving, at average, 620€ per year can be a big leap forward in people’s lives and with smart investments, the money saved on the electrical bill can become a game changer to entrepreneurs and companies.


## CFD Machine Learning Module

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is (...). Such precision and complexity requires computational time. With enough data it is possible to generalize the previous simulations to other cases. I built a module that makes easier for a team to predict the other results of CFD simulations.

A module that does:
Pre-Processing of the data such as reading and compiling the data, feature scaling, splitting the data, defining training sets, etc. ;
Chooses the best Machine Learning Module to use and choses the best hyper parameters to use;
Interprets the data from the hyperparameters selection;
Creates a Machine Learning Playground where the data is fitted in a selected model (this model can be selected or choosen automaticly via the module calculations);
Tests the data and gives visual comparisson with previous simulation results;

### Tools Used
Coded in python and used Data-Science libraries such as pandas and numpy, machine learning libraries sklearn and ngboost and Deep Learning library Tensorflow.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

## Feedforward neural network with regularization

[Github](https://github.com/) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).
