## Promoting Energy and Economic Empowerment with Python
Data Transformation and Machine learning

### Project Info
I created a tool to do solar power simulations over a 20 year time and tested it on my city, Porto, with several values of electricity average monthly bills. The goal is to give, for each average monthly bill, the best solar solution (which and how many solar panels, if a battery, and which battery, would be a good idea) to maximize the return of the investment.
The report was published by [Towards Data Science](https://github.com/).
This report can be useful by consumers or companies.
The most important parts of the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/perkier/Perkier.Energy). The code can be found 

### Tools Used
Code written in python with Data-Science libraries such as Pandas, sklearn and numpy, PVlib (Solar PV library) and Beautiful Soup (Web Scrapping Library).
Machine Learning techniques to fit a consumption function curve that was scanned through a plot digitizer package which converted the curve to a x,y coordinates text file. I created a function that would fit the points that I had previously marked on the plot digitizer package. Several polifit functions with different regression degrees were run and the degree with less error was found.

### Results
It was proven that solar panels can be a great long-term investment and batteries can make that investment even more profitable.
We can draw a line between the number of watts hour consumed during a time period and the number of solar panels that your house should need. The number of panels installed should be able to generate that power at the same time period. That way, the solar installation will generate 200% emotional profit and 400% of real, monetary, profit.
Renewable energies can be a great way to empower new generations of people. Saving, at average, 620€ per year can be a big leap forward in people’s lives and with smart investments, the money saved on the electrical bill can become a game changer to entrepreneurs and companies.


## CFD Machine Learning Module 
Data Science tools to handle and prepare the data; Machine Learning Regression; Deep Learning Regression;

### Project Info
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is (...). Such precision and complexity requires computational time. With enough data it is possible to generalize the previous simulations to other cases. I built a module that makes easier for a team to predict the other results of CFD simulations.

A module that does:
Pre-Processing of the data such as reading and compiling the data, feature scaling, splitting the data, defining training sets, etc. ;
Chooses the best Machine Learning Module to use and choses the best hyper parameters to use;
Interprets the data from the hyperparameters selection;
Creates a Machine Learning Playground where the data is fitted in a selected model (this model can be selected or choosen automaticly via the module calculations);
Tests the data and gives visual comparisson with previous simulation results;
