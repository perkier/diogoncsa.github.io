# Diogo's Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of ABCS.

## Stand-alone projects.

### PROJECT 1

This is my own project  [here](https://youtube.com/). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/).

### PROJECT 1

A conversational chatbot in [telegram](http://t.me/)  [nlp course by Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/home/welcome).

## Kaggle competitions.

### Kaggle_1

[Avito demand prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction).


## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.



## Regression problems.

## Neural networks

### Feedforward neural network with regularization

[Github](https://github.com/) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

## Data exploration and analysis
